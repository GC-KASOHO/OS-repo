# File Management Application - Task Assignment

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a file management application with features such as file operations (copy, move, delete, rename), secure vault encryption, task scheduling, file health checks, insights dashboard, and more. The application will have both a GUI interface and a browser-based HTML Application (HTA) interface.

## 3. Programming (Front-End)  
**Leader: Daniel**  
**Members: Edriane, Kevin, Gerald, Michael**

### 3.1 Windows GUI Interface (`FileManagerGUI.ps1`)  
- **Assigned to: Kirby**
    - [ ] Design and implement the PowerShell GUI interface.
    - [ ] Create interactive elements (buttons, menus, file viewers).
    - [ ] Integrate with the back-end functions.
    - **Contents of File**:
        - PowerShell script for GUI layout.
        - UI components like buttons, labels, and input fields.
        - Code to connect UI elements with back-end functions.

### 3.2 Browser-Based Interface (`FileManager.hta`)  
- **Assigned to: Kirby**
    - [ ] Create a browser-based HTML Application (HTA).
    - [ ] Design the layout using HTML and style it with CSS.
    - [ ] Integrate JavaScript for dynamic file operations (copy, delete, etc.).
    - **Contents of File**:
        - HTML structure for the app (layout, form elements, buttons).
        - CSS for styling the app's appearance.
        - JavaScript to handle dynamic actions (e.g., triggering file operations from the UI).

### 3.3 Main Entry Script (`FileManager.ps1`)  
- **Assigned to: Edriane**
    - [ ] Create the main entry point for launching the GUI or HTA interface.
    - [ ] Ensure it detects the preferred interface (PowerShell GUI or HTA).
    - **Contents of File**:
